My name is Bahas B and I have come to the United States all the way from the Bahamas.
It was a long and arduous journey but I have finally made it here. I am excited to meet new people and learn more about the world. My favorite drink is Baha Blast from taco bell as it sounds similar to my name. If I were describe myself I would say I am tall and thin 
but I am full of spirit! I am currently living in Wisconsin-Madison hoping to have fun in this amazing college!
